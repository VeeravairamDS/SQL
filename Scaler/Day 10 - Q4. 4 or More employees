Problem Statement:
Write a query to display the "full_name" (first name and last name separated by space) of a manager who manages 4 or more employees.
Note:
Return the result ordered by full_name in ascending order.
The column manager_id in the employees table represents the employee_id of the manager.

CODE:
select
concat (first_name,' ', last_name) as full_name
from employees
WHERE employee_id IN (SELECT manager_id FROM employees GROUP BY manager_id HAVING COUNT(*) >= 4)
order by full_name;
