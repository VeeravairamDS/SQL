Problem Statement:
Based on the employee's salary, divide the employees into three different classes.
Salary greater than 20,000 (i.e, excluding 20,000) as 'Class A'
Salary between 10,000 to 20,000 (i.e, including both 10,000 and 20,000) as 'Class B'
Salary less than 10,000 (i.e, excluding 10,000) as 'Class C'. Return the new column as 'Salary_bin'.
Return the columns 'employee_id', 'salary', and 'Salary_bin'.
Return the result ordered by employee_id in ascending order.

CODE:
select employee_id, salary,
case
when (salary > 20000) then 'Class A'
when (salary between 10000 and 20000) then 'Class B'
else 'Class C' 
end as Salary_bin
from employees
order by employee_id;
