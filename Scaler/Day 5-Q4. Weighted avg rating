Write a query to display the top 10 movies and their rating up to two decimals based on the newly created column.
Return the columns original_title, Weighted_avg_rating
Return the output ordered by Weighted_avg_rating in descending order and original_title in ascending order.

(v/(v+m) * R) + (m/(m+v) * C )

CODE:
select 
original_title,
round((vote_count/(vote_count+104.0)*vote_average)+(104.0/(104.0+vote_count)*5.97),2) as Weighted_avg_rating
from movies
order by Weighted_avg_rating desc,original_title
limit 10;
